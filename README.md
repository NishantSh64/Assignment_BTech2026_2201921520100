            Create a program to model a Library system using Object-Oriented principles like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
            
            The system should have the following components:
            
            Book class, which should include:

            A method to add a book to the library
            A method to display all books in the library
            Main class, which will:
            
            Create a library object
            Add books to the library
            Display all the books in the library

            A Member class with attributes: memberId, name, and a method to borrow/return books.
            A Library class that manages books and members, allowing book borrowing and returning.
Problem Statement for 30 January:  Online Shopping System

Problem 31 January: Online Food Ordering System
            Create an Online Food Ordering System that allows customers to order food from a restaurant.
            
            Requirements:
            Add food items to the menu.
            Place and manage orders.
            Track the status of each order (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Delivered).
            Calculate the total bill.
            Classes to Implement:
            FoodItem: Represents a food item with itemId, name, price, and category.
            Order: Contains details like orderId, list of FoodItems, status, and totalAmount.
            Customer: Holds customer information such as customerId, name, and order history.
            Restaurant: Manages the menu and orders, with methods to add food items, place orders, and update order status.
            Key OOP Concepts:
            Abstraction to hide complex order management.
            Encapsulation to secure customer and order details.
            Inheritance if different types of food items exist (e.g., Beverage, Main Course).
Problem 1: Banking System
            Design a Banking System using OOP concepts to manage customer accounts and transactions.
            
            Requirements:
            Create new bank accounts (Savings and Current accounts).

            Apply interest to savings accounts.
            Track transaction history for each account.
            Classes to Implement:
            Account: Base class with attributes like accountNumber, accountHolderName, and balance.
            SavingsAccount & CurrentAccount: Inherit from Account, with SavingsAccount having an interestRate and interest calculation method.
            Transaction: Represents a transaction with transactionId, amount, type (deposit/withdrawal), and date.
            Bank: Manages accounts and transactions with methods to create accounts, process transactions, and view transaction history.
            Key OOP Concepts:
            Inheritance to differentiate between SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount.
            Encapsulation to protect sensitive data like account balance.
            Polymorphism for handling different types of transactions.
