            Requirements:
            Add food items to the menu.
            Place and manage orders.

            Bank: Manages accounts and transactions with methods to create accounts, process transactions, and view transaction history.
            Key OOP Concepts:
            Inheritance to differentiate between SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount.
            Encapsulation to protect sensitive data like account balance.
            Polymorphism for handling different types of transactions.
